 Do not give up on your goals. The tool won't let you anyways ðŸ˜ˆ
</p>

## Description

Bacior is a standalone tool that is good at only one thing -- making sure you deliver your goals by a small steps.

## How does it work?

- You specify your goal and amount of iterations it requires
- Tool prepares a `Progress sheet` which lists iterations and their `due dates`
- Tool notifies you `every 1 hour` in specific hour-range (currently 2PM-11PM) until you mark the iteration as `done`


## Current limitations

I was creating this tooling with only one specific goal in mind - to read more books. <br>
Thus why following limitations exist:
- Tool is looking for polish-named headers
- Tool is only useful for book reading related goals.
- Tool can not notify anyone other besides the owner & also is vendor-locked on PagerDuty
